# GraphicsEditor

Made by Flairieve!

## About
This plugin was built in Godot v3.1 and is currently in alpha so it doesn't work fully and it's not finished!

Right now it can create basic images in a 100x100 resolution.
It is using a chunk system to keep rendering optmized!

### Stuff that's still WIP and are not finished:
* The bucket tool lags and the selection tool doesn't work at all!
* The way in which the program saves temporary data doesn't do it in chunks yet!
* There is no custom color selection tool yet so the color picker doesn't work on it.
* All chunks are always rendered which causes lag when there is more chunks.
* There is no way to change the resolution of the image.
* Images can only save in the PNG format.
* You can't zoom in and out on the image! Either a Camera2D can be used or every control node can be scaled!
